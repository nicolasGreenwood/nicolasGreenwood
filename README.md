- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicolas Greenwood.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, writing poetry and amateur filmmaking. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end web development, with my current interests including exploring static site generators like Jekyll and Eleventy, using new design tools like Tailwind CSS and Sass, and diving deep into web typography.
